# ACCESS Data Inventory

Unified documentation for ACCESS data sources, APIs, and MCP tools.

## Goals

The ACCESS ecosystem spans dozens of data sources across multiple teams and tracks. This project exists to bring clarity and structure to that landscape so teams can work with data more effectively.

- **Catalog every ACCESS data source** in a single, version-controlled inventory
- **Document fields, relationships, and access levels** so consumers know what's available and how to use it
- **Enable discovery across tracks** by generating browsable docs and interactive diagrams
- **Power AI tools and automation** by providing machine-readable metadata that integrates with MCP servers, agents, and other workflows

## How It Works

1. **Edit** a markdown file in `data-sources/`
2. **Commit** and push to `main`
3. **Done** - GitHub Actions regenerates all docs automatically

The generated documentation is published to:
- **GitHub Pages** - browsable docs and interactive relationship diagram
- **dbdocs.io** - interactive ERD at https://dbdocs.io/access-ci/access-data-inventory

## Adding or Editing a Data Source

Edit or create a `.md` file in `data-sources/`. Each file has YAML frontmatter for structured data and markdown for notes.

### Minimal Example

```markdown
---
id: my_source
name: My Data Source
description: What this source contains
category: Community & Outreach
track: Support
responsible_team: Support
access_level: Public
is_canonical: false
canonical_source: null
api_endpoint: null
priority: Medium

mcp:
  available: false
  package: null
  tools: []

fields: []
relationships: []

### Field Properties

| Property | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Field name |
| `type` | Yes | `int`, `varchar`, `text`, `boolean`, `date`, `timestamp`, `decimal` |
| `access` | Yes | `Public`, `Authenticated`, `Restricted`, `Internal Only`, `Sensitive` |
| `description` | Yes | What this field contains |
| `primary_key` | No | Set `true` for primary key |
| `required` | No | Set `true` if field is required |
| `mcp_name` | No | Field name in MCP if different |
| `computed` | No | Set `true` if calculated/derived |
| `references` | No | Foreign key reference (e.g., `users.user_id`) |
| `allowed_values` | No | List of valid values |
| `semantic_type` | No | Controlled vocabulary tag for cross-source field matching (see [Semantic Types](#semantic-types)) |

### Allowed Values

**category:** Community & Outreach, Events & Training, Users & Identity, Content Management, Allocations, Resources, Operations, Metrics & Reporting

**track:** Support, Operations, Allocations, ACO

**access_level:** Public, Authenticated, Restricted, Internal Only, Sensitive, Varies

**priority:** High, Medium, Low

### Use Cases

The `use_cases` property is an optional list of plain-language questions that a data source can help answer. These appear in the field dictionary and help stakeholders understand the practical value of each data source.

```yaml
use_cases:
  - What training sessions are available for beginners this month?
  - Which events are associated with a specific affinity group?
```

### Constraints

The `constraints` property documents policy, privacy, or regulatory restrictions on a data source. Each constraint has a `type` (from the controlled vocabulary below) and a free-text `description`.

```yaml
constraints:
  - type: privacy
    description: Contains PII that must not be exposed through public APIs.
  - type: acceptable_use
    description: Data may only be used for event management and reporting.
```

**constraint_type:** privacy, acceptable_use, licensing, retention, regulatory

### Semantic Types

The `semantic_type` property is an optional tag on individual fields that links equivalent fields across different data sources. For example, `title` in events, `title` in announcements, and `title` in Drupal nodes all serve the same purpose — `entity_name` captures that relationship.

```yaml
fields:
  - name: title
    type: varchar
    access: Public
    description: Event title
    semantic_type: entity_name
```

Fields that are foreign key references (with a `references` property) should generally NOT have a `semantic_type` — the relationship is already captured by the reference.

**semantic_type vocabulary:**

| Type | Covers fields like | Purpose |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| `entity_id` | id, nid, user_id | Primary/business identifier |
| `uuid` | uuid | Universal unique identifier |
| `entity_name` | title, name (of a thing) | Human-readable name/title |
| `entity_description` | description, body | Full descriptive content |
| `entity_summary` | summary, goals | Short-form summary |
| `entity_type` | event_type, type, category | Classification |
| `entity_status` | status, attendance_status | Lifecycle state |
| `date_start` / `date_end` | start_date, end_date | Time bounds |
| `date_published` | published_date | Publication timestamp |
| `date_created` / `date_modified` | created, changed | Record timestamps |
| `duration` / `time_relative` | duration_hours, starts_in_hours | Time measurements |
| `person_name` / `person_email` | name (of a person), email | PII fields |
| `institution` | institution | Org affiliation |
| `location` | location | Physical location |
| `url_registration` / `url_meeting` / `url_external` | registration_url, virtual_meeting_link | URL types |
| `contact_info` | contact, mailing_list | Contact details |
| `skill_level` | skill_level | Target audience level |
| `affiliation` | affiliation | ACCESS vs community |
| `media_ref` | image_id | Media references |
| `tags` | tags | Taxonomy tags |

This vocabulary is provisional and will evolve as more data sources are added. Adding, renaming, or removing types only requires editing the list in `schema.yaml`.

## Local Development

```bash
# First time setup
npm install
cd docs && bundle install && cd ..

# Generate + preview (recommended)
npm run preview
# Then open http://localhost:8080

# Or, step by step:
python generate.py              # Generate docs
npm run serve                   # Start Jekyll dev server

# Validate without generating
python generate.py --validate
```
