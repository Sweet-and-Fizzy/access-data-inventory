## Overview

Workshops, webinars, training sessions, and office hours offered by ACCESS and the community. The events MCP combines data from Drupal's eventseries and eventinstance content types into a unified view.

## Notes

- The `virtual_meeting_link` field requires authentication - not exposed to anonymous users
- `duration_hours` and `starts_in_hours` are computed fields calculated by the MCP
- Some events require registration; check `registration_url` for the signup link
- Events can overlap with ACO governance meetings - canonical source TBD
