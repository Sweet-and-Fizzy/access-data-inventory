## Overview

COManage is the identity management system for ACCESS. It stores user identity information including ACCESS IDs, email addresses, and institutional affiliations.

## Notes

- This data source contains PII and is classified as Sensitive
- Not suitable for AI/MCP exposure
- Other teams will contribute to the full user data model
- Users may have multiple ACCESS IDs (legacy XSEDE + ACCESS)
- Institutional affiliations may be outdated

## Access Considerations

Identity data should only be accessed by:
- Named individuals with legitimate need
- Systems with explicit authorization
- Never exposed through public APIs or AI tools
