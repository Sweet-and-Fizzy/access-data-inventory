## Overview

Announcements from resource providers and the ACCESS community. These are published on the ACCESS Support website and can be distributed via the bi-weekly digest email.

## Notes

- The announcements MCP supports full CRUD operations for authenticated users
- HTML content is preserved in the body field
- The `where_to_share` field is internal only - not exposed to public consumers
- Announcements can optionally be associated with an affinity group
