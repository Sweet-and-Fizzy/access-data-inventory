## Overview

Affinity groups are community-organized groups centered around shared interests, research domains, or resource provider communities. They provide a way for ACCESS users to connect with peers.

## Notes

- The MCP cleans HTML from the body field for cleaner display
- Coordinator is exposed as a name string in the MCP (not the user ID)
- Mailing list fields are restricted - not exposed via public API
- Private groups and their membership lists are restricted
