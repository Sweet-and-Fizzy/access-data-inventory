## Overview

ACCESS Support Drupal is the content management system that serves as the canonical storage backend for most Support track content. It powers the ACCESS Support website and provides APIs that feed the various MCP servers.

## Notes

- This is the **canonical source** for announcements, events, and affinity groups
- Content is created and edited directly in Drupal by authorized users
- Specialized REST APIs expose content for consumption by MCP servers
- Not directly exposed as an MCP itself - data flows through content-specific MCPs
- Dynamic content - users can create/edit at any time

## Data Flow

```
ACCESS Support Drupal (canonical)
    │
    ├── /api/2.0/announcements → announcements MCP
    ├── /api/2.0/events → events MCP
    ├── /api/1.0/affinity_groups → affinity-groups MCP
    └── (direct) → tags, taxonomy
```

## Content Types

- **announcement** - News and updates from RPs and community
- **eventseries** - Recurring event definitions
- **eventinstance** - Specific occurrences of events
- **affinity_group** - Community group pages
- **page** - Static documentation pages
- **article** - General articles and guides
